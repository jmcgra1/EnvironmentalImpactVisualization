# Notes

All emission estimates are expressed in thousand metric tons of carbon. To
convert these estimates to units of carbon dioxide (CO2), simply multiply
these estimates by 3.667.

Per capita emission estimates are expressed in metric tons of carbon.
Population estimates were not available to permit calculations of global per
capita estimates before 1950.  Please note that annual sums were tallied before
each element (e.g., Gas) was rounded and reported here so totals may differ
slightly from the sum of the elements due to rounding.

## Methods

Publications containing historical energy statistics make it possible to
estimate fossil fuel CO2 emissions back to 1751. Etemad et al. (1991)
published a summary compilation that tabulates coal, brown coal, peat, and
crude oil production by nation and year. Footnotes in the Etemad et al.(1991)
publication extend the energy statistics time series back to 1751. Summary
compilations of fossil fuel trade were published by Mitchell (1983, 1992, 1993,
1995). Mitchell's work tabulates solid and liquid fuel imports and exports by
nation and year. These pre-1950 production and trade data were digitized and
CO2 emission calculations were made following the procedures discussed in
Marland and Rotty (1984) and Boden et al. (1995). Further details on the
contents and processing of the historical energy statistics are provided in
Andres et al. (1999).

The 1950 to present CO2 emission estimates are derived primarily from energy
statistics published by the United Nations (2016), using the methods of Marland
and Rotty (1984). The energy statistics were compiled primarily from annual
questionnaires distributed by the U.N. Statistical Office and supplemented by
official national statistical publications. As stated in the introduction of
the Statistical Yearbook, "in a few cases, official sources are supplemented by
other sources and estimates, where these have been subjected to professional
scrutiny and debate and are consistent with other independent sources." Data
from the U.S. Department of Interior's Geological Survey (USGS 2016) were used
to estimate CO2 emitted during cement production. Values for emissions from gas
flaring were derived primarily from U.N. data but were supplemented with data
from the U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration (1994),
Rotty (1974), and data provided by G. Marland. Greater details about these
methods are provided in Marland and Rotty (1984), Boden et al. (1995), and
Andres et al. (1999).
